# Plugin Bundle SSOT Contract

The repository keeps one canonical authoring surface for each plugin/setup asset type and treats `plugins/oh-my-codex` as generated-or-verified plugin output.

## Canonical roots

- **Plugin skills:** root `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is canonical. The plugin mirror at `plugins/oh-my-codex/skills/<name>/` is refreshed by `npm run sync:plugin` and verified by `npm run verify:plugin-bundle`.
- **Plugin skill membership:** `templates/catalog-manifest.json` controls which catalog skills are installable. Active/internal skills, plus setup-only policy additions, must have canonical root skill directories and plugin mirrors.
- **Plugin MCP metadata:** `src/config/omx-first-party-mcp.ts` is canonical. `plugins/oh-my-codex/.mcp.json` must match `buildOmxPluginMcpManifest()`.
- **Plugin manifest version and paths:** `package.json` is canonical for the plugin version. The plugin manifest must point to `./skills/`, `./.mcp.json`, and `./.app.json`.
- **Native agents and prompts:** root `prompts/` plus `src/agents/definitions.ts` are setup-owned canonical sources. The official plugin intentionally does not ship plugin-scoped `agents`, `prompts`, or hooks.

## Commands

```bash
npm run sync:plugin           # mutate plugin mirror/metadata from canonical roots
npm run verify:plugin-bundle  # non-mutating SSOT check for CI/review
npm run sync:plugin:check     # compatibility alias for the same non-mutating check
```

`prepack` runs sync and verification before packaging, but contributors should run the non-mutating verification before review so release-time sync does not hide stale plugin artifacts.

## Adding or changing a skill

1. Edit or add the root skill under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Add/update the skill entry in `templates/catalog-manifest.json` and `src/catalog/manifest.json`.
3. Run `npm run build && npm run sync:plugin`.
4. Run `npm run verify:plugin-bundle`.

Root skill directories that should not appear in the plugin must be represented in the catalog as `alias` or `merged`; otherwise the plugin bundle verifier fails because the root directory is neither installable nor explicitly excluded.
